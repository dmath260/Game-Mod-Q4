Tactical Strogg Takedown


A new mod for Quake 4 that focuses more on exploration, inventory management, and puzzle solving than pure combat. This mod adds new weapons, new powerups, a new dialog system, and a new quest system. More coming soonâ„¢


How to play:

Download "game000.pk4," "pak001.pk4," and the "Quake 4 Mod" shortcut from the Downloads folder

Open file explorer and find the local files for Quake 4 (on Steam, this is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 4)

Create a new folder in this directory called "q4puzzle" and put both .pk4 files in the folder

Launch the shortcut, and it will immediately load the mod


Enjoy!
